                                            He
                                            was a quick learner,
                                            motivated, and capable of handling ambiguous tasks. His proposal was the
                                            best
                                            and most organized among all the candidates, which is why our open-source
                                            organization selected him. His hard work and deliverables proved he was not

                                            good at writing proposals :-)

                                            I had the pleasure of working with Chaitanya for around 2 years at
                                            CommerceIQ.
                                            Chaitanya is a highly focused person and can add to any team he is a part
                                            of.
                                            During his 2 years tenure at CIQ, his contributions were spread across
                                            multiple
                                            teams and projects - DevOps, data platform, and market share application and
                                            he
                                            nailed it every time. He is a rational thinker and a hard-working individual
                                            who
                                            always have a constant appetite for learning new things, be it development
                                            learning new technology, or cloud solutions. His work ethic is immaculate
                                            and so
                                            he is very easy to work with. He even goes out of his way when you ask for
                                            any
                                            help and guidance - we did a lot of successful POCs together. He has always
                                            been
                                            an asset to the team where he is in.

                                        New Client Setup Revamp: Successfully revamped the new client setup process,
                                        saving the team
                                        hours of work on a daily basis. By creating an SQL dump and implementing
                                        parallel setups, we are now
                                        8x times more efficient, enabling us to deliver top-quality service to our
                                        clients while streamlining our
                                        internal operations.
                                        Market Share Pipeline: I collaborated with the Data Science team to modularize
                                        their monolithic
                                        Jupyter notebooks into a Python framework for their market share analytics
                                        offering that utilizes ML
                                        models. This implementation streamlined their code review and release process,
                                        ensuring conflict free development. In addition, I designed a pipeline using
                                        SageMaker Processing Jobs and AWS
                                        Step Functions to collect data and run the ML models. The pipeline supported
                                        dynamic inputs, proper
                                        logging, notifications, scheduling, and monitoring. Through this project, I
                                        demonstrated my expertise
                                        in AWS and Python, as well as my ability to collaborate effectively across teams
                                        to deliver successful
                                        solutions.
                                        AVC Service: I created a microservice in JAVA called AVC Service. This powerful
                                        tool integrates
                                        directly with Amazon's APIs, allowing us to download reports and ingest data
                                        into our databases quickly
                                        and efficiently. By removing our dependency on scraping, we significantly
                                        increased the speed and
                                        accuracy of our data ingestion process, enhancing the overall performance of our
                                        platform.

                                        <br>
                                        As a member of the infra team, I played an instrumental role in developing
                                        multi-cloud services like
                                        Nandi - a powerful tool for performing CRUD operations on secrets shared across
                                        the company. I
                                        also automated SOC2 audit reports using open-source tools like Cloud Custodian
                                        and created an
                                        automated AWS Cloud cost report that analyzed increasing costs across various
                                        CIQ systems and
                                        AWS services, which resulted in significant cost reductions for our teams.
                                        Additionally, I worked on
                                        developing Terraform modules to streamline and accelerate the deployment of our
                                        infrastructure.
                                        Through these contributions, I was able to showcase my technical skills and help
                                        our company stay at
                                        the forefront of cutting-edge technology.
